    <h2>Learning to Simulate Robot Worlds</h2>
    <h4>CVPR 2026 Workshop</h4>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="row main-content">
  <p><b><mark>Call for Papers</mark></b>
    We are sourcing two different types of papers: four-page papers and one-page abstracts, focusing on learning to simulate robot worlds and their applications in robotics. Specific topics of interest include:
    <ul>
      <li>Real-to-Sim and Sim-to-Real Learning: How to use real-world data to create simulations and how to learn and evaluate robot policies in such simulations?</li>
      <li>Photorealistic Differentiable Simulation for Robotics: How can robotics leverage photorealistic reconstructions or digital twins?</li>
      <li>Learnable Physics Simulations and System Identification: Making physics simulation learnable and differentiable, so that robots can identify unknown parameters and even improve the simulator itself.</li>
      <li>Reconstruction and generation of articulated and deformable objects</li>
      <li>Policy training and evaluation with learned world models, realistic simulations and digital twins</li>
      <li>End-to-end world models learning</li>
      <li>Explicit vs. implicit world models</li>
      <li>Compositional world models and controllable video generation models</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p><b> Submission Policy: </b></p>
  <p>
  <ul>
    <li>We encourage two types of submissions:
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Novel Papers:</strong> 4-page submissions presenting new perspectives or experimental results. Should contain up to 4 pages of main paper plus any number of pages for references and supplementary material</li>
        <li><strong>Abstracts from previously published work:</strong> One-page abstracts summarizing work that has already been published or accepted at other venues. The abstract should highlight the main contributions and explain the relevance to the workshop topic. Please also include a link to the online proceedings page for the original publication. <strong>Note:</strong> Papers accepted to CoRL 2025 are <em>not</em> eligible for submission.</li>
      </ol>
    <li>We ask authors to use the supplementary material only for minor details that do not fit in the main paper. We reserve the right to desk reject papers that strongly violate this format (e.g., more than 4 pages of main content before references)</li>
    <li>4-page submissions should be fully anonymized for double-blind review.</li>
    <li>Accepted submissions will appear on the workshop website (non-archival).</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
